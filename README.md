### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [Guided Research](https://github.com/Brucknem/GuidedResearch) project at Providentia++.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Vision based Camera Stabilization and Calibration techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Computer Vision and Machine Learning related.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I'm happy to discuss any topic and even more if I can help you. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The email related to this account if visible. Otherwise create an issue on any of my projects and I will respond to you.
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are a lot of nice organisations like [4Ocean](https://www.4ocean.com/) or [German Zero](https://www.germanzero.de) that fight against worldwide pollution and climate change. They are always happy to get support.
